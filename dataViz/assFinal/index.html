          An account of Uttar Pradesh(UP)'s political evolution, and what the 2022 result means for UP and India
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"></br></br>As the results of Uttar Pradesh's elections finally came out on the 12th of March, 2022 after a long month of voting across 7 phases, there is a lot being said about the implications of these results not only in the run-up to the 2024 National (Lok Sabha) elections but also in the context of its recent trends in political representation on the future of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and, by its hegemony, India. <br><br>

          <iframe src='https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/8933720/embed' title='Interactive or visual content' class='flourish-embed-iframe' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' style='width:100%;height:600px;' sandbox='allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation'></iframe><div style='width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;'></div>

        </br>However, before we try to understand UP's present, we need to understand its past; the political evolution of the state from the era of Congress dominance until the 70s, to political instability in the 80s, leading to the rise of two ambitious political projects that were launched almost simultaneously in the politically turbulent early part of the 90s - the Mandal and the Mandir. 

        <ul><li><b>the Mandal:</b> Having acquired wealth from agriculture and political power through elections, the Other Backward Castes (OBCs) - a term used by the Government of India to classify castes which are educationally or socially disadvantaged, realised that they had little share in the country’s administrative and executive apparatus. So they started clamouring for reservations in government jobs. Until 1977, this demand fell on deaf ears. 
          <br><br> But the Janata government, headed by Morarji Desai, appointed the Mandal Commission in 1978 to study this demand. By the time the commission submitted its report recommending 27% reservation in government jobs for the OBCs, the Janata government was history and the Congress led by Indira Gandhi was back in power, who didn't act on the document along with her successor Rajiv Gandhi.
          <br><br> However, when Janata government came back to power with V.P. Singh on top, he decided to implement the Mandal Commission's recommendations. This saw many regional socialist political parties like Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) emerging at that time, who sought empowerment of minorities inside and outside the Mandal Commission report. The politics of these parties is said to be the 'Mandal Politics' </li><br>
          
          <li><b>the Mandir:</b> While the Congress' stand remained opposed to the Mandal Commission recommendation, the other major national party - the BJP decided not to take any position on the Mandal issue due to its political ramifications, but to “shift the terms of political debate from Mandal and caste to religion by resurrecting the old crusade for the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya at the site where still stood the Babri masjid, for this was Lord Ram’s birthplace”. This plan of 'reclaiming' Hindu nationalism by its president, L. K. Advani, led to a kind of socio-religious politics said to be the 'Mandir Politics'. </li>
        </ul>

        VP Singh’s ‘Mandal’ strategy ran headlong into Advani’s ‘Mandir’. The Mandal versus Mandir politics resulted in a tussle that’s defined Uttar Pradesh's politics since then: Can you re-unite by faith what caste divided? While the Mandir won in 1991, the Mandal politics parties - the BSP and the SP, ended up winning the state elections for the next few tenures. 

        <br><br> However, the 2017 elections saw the BJP swinging back to power after a long drought, winning a majority of seats on the clout of the populist Narendra Modi at the Centre. The just-concluded 2022 UP elections has re-confirmed the recent rise of the Mandir back over the Mandal. Hence from the point of view of these ideas, this elections had some historic takeaways:</div></br></br>
