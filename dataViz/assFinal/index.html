          An account of Uttar Pradesh(UP)'s political evolution, and what the 2022 result means for UP and India
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"></br></br>As the results of Uttar Pradesh's elections finally came out on the 12th of March, 2022 after a long month of voting across 7 phases, there is a lot being said about the implications of these results not only in the run-up to the 2024 National (Lok Sabha) elections but also in the context of what these recent trends mean to the future of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and, by its hegemony, India. <br><br>

          <iframe src='https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/8933720/embed' title='Interactive or visual content' class='flourish-embed-iframe' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' style='width:100%;height:600px;' sandbox='allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation'></iframe><div style='width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;'></div>

        </br>However, before we try to understand UP's present, we need to understand its past; the political evolution of the state from the era of Congress dominance until the 70s, to political instability in the 80s, leading to the rise of two ambitious political projects that were launched almost simultaneously in the politically turbulent early part of the 90s - the Mandal and the Mandir, and how they shaped the reality of today.

            <!--<p class='explain'>50% offset</p>-->
            <div class='block block-b'><p>The Congress times</p></div>
            <div class='' style="width: 35rem;">The Congress, the party that shaped a major part of the Indian National Movement, had a grip of Uttar Pradesh's political leadership until tje late 70s and was the principle party of the State, with only a few hiccups. With the bare exception of Charan Singh's victory in 1967 backed by socialists Ram Manohar Lohia and Raj Narain that led to an unstable government, a major part of which went under the President's Rule, the Congress pretty much was leading the state, directly or indirectly.</div>
            
            <div class='block block-b'><p>Chaos</p></div>
            <div class='' style="width: 35rem;">The game changed after Indira Gandhi's infamous national emergency from 1975-1977. A new front, the Janata Dal, emerged in 1977 headed by Morarji Desai, the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India. This was a political regime with too many instable factions, however. The instability in politics of the periods saw 7 different Chief Ministers in the next decade. This also led to the Congress reclaiming back its pole position in the state.<br><br>

            On the side, however, a socio-political movement was brewing. Having acquired wealth from agriculture and political power through elections, the Other Backward Castes (OBCs) - a term used by the Government of India to classify castes which are educationally or socially disadvantaged, realised that they had little share in the country’s administrative and executive apparatus. So under Ram Manohar Lohiya, an ideology-driven socialist movement that sought adequate representation for backward castes galvanised caste leaders in the 1970s, though it never truly translated into a full-blown political force. Until 1977, this representation demand fell on deaf ears.</div>              
            
            <div class='block block-b'><p>The Mandal</p></div>
            <div class='' style="width: 35rem;">The Janata Dal government, headed by Morarji Desai, appointed the Mandal Commission in 1978 to study the demand of OBCs. However, by the time the commission submitted its report recommending reservation in government jobs for the OBCs, the Janata government was ousted by the Congress under Indira Gandhi. She, along with her successor Rajiv Gandhi, didn't act on the recommendations of the committee as they believed it would open a political pandora's box. 
            <br><br> This period saw many regional socialist political parties like Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) emerge at that time, who sought empowerment of minorities inside and outside the Mandal Commission report. The politics of these parties is said to be 'Mandal Politics'. The Janata Dal, backed by all Mandal parties and the BJP, came back to power in 1989 and under V.P. Singh decided to implement the controversial Mandal Commission's recommendations. Thus emerged a new political clout, that of 'Mandal-ism', emerged.<br></div>

            <div class='block block-b'><p>The Mandir</p></div>
            <div class='' style="width: 35rem;">While the Congress' stand remained opposed to the Mandal Commission recommendation, the other major national party - the BJP decided not to take any position on the Mandal issue due to its political ramifications, but to “shift the terms of political debate from Mandal and caste to religion by resurrecting the old crusade for the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya at the site where still stood the Babri masjid, for this was Lord Ram’s birthplace”. This plan of 'reclaiming' Hindu nationalism by its president, L. K. Advani, led to a kind of socio-religious politics said to be the 'Mandir Politics'. <br></div>

        <div class='block block-b' style="align-items: center; justify-content: center;"><p>The present</p></div>
        <div style="padding-left: 24.5%; padding-right: 22%;">VP Singh’s ‘Mandal’ strategy ran headlong into Advani’s ‘Mandir’. The Mandal versus Mandir politics resulted in a tussle that’s defined Uttar Pradesh's politics since then: <i><b>Can you re-unite by faith what caste divided? </b></i> While the Mandir won in 1991, the Mandal politics parties - the BSP and the SP, ended up winning the state elections for the next few tenures. However, the 2022 UP elections has re-confirmed the recent rise of the Mandir back over the Mandal. Hence from the point of view of these ideas, this elections had some historic takeaways:
